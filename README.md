# Random Password Generator

## Overview

This project is a secure and customizable password generator built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to generate random passwords based on selected character types and password length. Users can also evaluate the strength of the password, copy it to their clipboard, and export it to a file. The application focuses on usability, modular design, and data security principles.


## Features

* Generate passwords of custom length
* Include/exclude letters, numbers, and symbols
* Exclude ambiguous characters (e.g., O, 0, I, l, 1)
* Option to allow or prevent character repetition
* Visual strength meter based on password complexity
* Copy generated password to clipboard
* Export password to a timestamped text file
* Pressing the **Enter** key also triggers password generation
* Input validation and clear error messages


## Theory and Concepts

### Password Composition

Passwords are generated by combining selected character sets:

* Letters: A–Z, a–z
* Numbers: 0–9
* Symbols: e.g., ! @ # \$ %
* Ambiguous characters can be excluded to avoid confusion

### Strength Evaluation

Password strength is estimated based on:

* Length (longer passwords are generally stronger)
* Character diversity (using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols)

In this app, passwords are classified as:

* **Strong**: Length ≥12 and uses letters, numbers, and symbols
* **Medium**: Length ≥8 and uses at least two character types
* **Weak**: Shorter length or limited character types

### GUI Design

The graphical interface (built with Tkinter) includes:

* Input field for password length
* Checkboxes to include/exclude character types and repetition
* Buttons to generate, copy, and export password
* Password display field and real-time strength meter
* Pressing the **Enter** key also triggers password generation, making it quicker to use
* Popup error handling for invalid inputs

### Clipboard Integration

Uses `pyperclip` to let users copy the generated password directly to the clipboard.

### File Export

Passwords can be saved to `.txt` files named with the current date and time.


## How It Works

1. User selects password length and options (letters, numbers, symbols, repetition, exclude ambiguous characters).
   
2. Clicks **“Generate Password”** (or presses the **Enter** key):
   * Character pool is built based on selections.
   * Password is created randomly, ensuring at least one character from each chosen type.
   * Password is shuffled and displayed.
   * Strength meter updates based on length and complexity.
    
3. User can:
   * Copy the password to the clipboard.
   * Export it as a text file.

4. Errors (like no character types selected) show popup messages.


## Project Structure

```
password_generator/
├── main.py              # Entry point: connects GUI and logic
├── gui.py               # GUI layout and widgets
└── logic.py             # Password generation, strength evaluation, copy/export functions

```


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter
* Random and string modules (built-in)
* datetime (for file export timestamps)
* pyperclip (for clipboard)

Install pyperclip:

```bash
pip install pyperclip
```


## Running the Application

From the project directory, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The GUI window will open for password generation.


## Possible Enhancements

* Dark mode or theme customization
* History of generated passwords
* Bulk password generation
* More detailed strength calculation (e.g., entropy)
* Tooltips explaining each setting
